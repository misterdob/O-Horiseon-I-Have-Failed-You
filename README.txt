This was the best I could do.

I saw it, decided after a lot of head-bashing that I couldn't untangle it, and decided to try and build it from scratch. I didn't once ask for help. (Joe tried to help at the very end, and I do appreciate him, but it was too little too late at that point)

I definitely plan on completing this properly and re-submitting (via SLACK, not BCS!!) over the span of winter break, where I'll finally be able to catch my breath and get set for the real grind. I did learn quite a bit from the whole experience though, my limitations and whatnot. I'm still very very dedicated to this course and I plan on proving that to you in the near future.

On to the next assignment, then!
